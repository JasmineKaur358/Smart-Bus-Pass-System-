The Smart Bus Pass Website is a digital solution designed to automate the process of bus pass registration, verification, and renewal. It allows users to apply online, upload ID proofs, and make secure payments through Razorpay (test mode). The system uses Tesseract OCR for automatic document verification and generates a unique QR-based digital bus pass for every approved user. Transport authorities can easily verify the pass by scanning the QR code, making the process fast, paperless, and efficient.
